**Difficulty:** 11

## Description

You have a blackboard and initially only an odd number x is written on it. Your goal is to write the number 1 on the blackboard.

You may write new numbers on the blackboard with the following two operations.

  * You may take two numbers (not necessarily distinct) already on the blackboard and write their sum on the blackboard. The two numbers you have chosen remain on the blackboard.
  * You may take two numbers (not necessarily distinct) already on the blackboard and write their [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) on the blackboard. The two numbers you have chosen remain on the blackboard.

Perform a sequence of operations such that at the end the number 1 is on the blackboard.

Input

The single line of the input contains the odd integer x (3 ≤ x ≤ 999,999).

Output

Print on the first line the number q of operations you perform. Then q lines should follow, each describing one operation.

  * The "sum" operation is described by the line "a + b", where a, b must be integers already present on the blackboard.
  * The "xor" operation is described by the line "a ^ b", where a, b must be integers already present on the blackboard.

The operation symbol (+ or ^) must be separated from a, b by a whitespace.

You can perform at most 100,000 operations (that is, q≤ 100,000) and all numbers written on the blackboard must be in the range [0, 5⋅10^{18}]. It can be proven that under such restrictions the required sequence of operations exists. You can output any suitable sequence of operations.
