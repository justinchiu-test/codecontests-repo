# 1325_C. Ehab and Path-etic MEXs

**ID:** 1325_c_ehab_and_pathetic_mexs_1064
**Difficulty:** 9

## Description

You are given a tree consisting of n nodes. You want to write some labels on the tree's edges such that the following conditions hold:

  * Every label is an integer between 0 and n-2 inclusive.
  * All the written labels are distinct.
  * The largest value among MEX(u,v) over all pairs of nodes (u,v) is as small as possible.



Here, MEX(u,v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that isn't written on any edge on the unique simple path from node u to node v.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of nodes in the tree.

Each of the next n-1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n) that mean there's an edge between nodes u and v. It's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

Output

Output n-1 integers. The i^{th} of them will be the number written on the i^{th} edge (in the input order).
