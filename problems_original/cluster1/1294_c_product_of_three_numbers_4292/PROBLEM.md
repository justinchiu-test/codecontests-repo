# 1294_C. Product of Three Numbers

**ID:** 1294_c_product_of_three_numbers_4292
**Difficulty:** 9

## Description

You are given one integer number n. Find three distinct integers a, b, c such that 2 ≤ a, b, c and a ⋅ b ⋅ c = n or say that it is impossible to do it.

If there are several answers, you can print any.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The next n lines describe test cases. The i-th test case is given on a new line as one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print the answer on it. Print "NO" if it is impossible to represent n as a ⋅ b ⋅ c for some distinct integers a, b, c such that 2 ≤ a, b, c.

Otherwise, print "YES" and any possible such representation.
