# Library Plan for Code Compression

After analyzing and refactoring several problems, I've identified common patterns and abstractions that can be reused across problems. Here's an updated plan for our library:

## 1. Input/Output Handling

These functions handle common I/O patterns:
- `read_int()`: Read a single integer
- `read_ints()`: Read a line of space-separated integers
- `read_graph(n, m, directed=False, indexed=1)`: Read a graph with n nodes and m edges
- `read_tree(n, indexed=1)`: Read a tree with n nodes

## 2. Graph/Tree Data Structures and Algorithms

Graph and tree operations are very common in the problems:
- `make_graph(n)`: Create an empty graph with n nodes
- `dfs(graph, start, visit_fn=None, visited=None)`: Depth-first search
- `bfs(graph, start, visit_fn=None)`: Breadth-first search
- `subtree_size(graph, node, parent=-1)`: Calculate subtree size
- `calculate_subtree_sizes(graph, root=0)`: Calculate sizes of all subtrees
- `tree_dfs(graph, node, parent=-1, pre_visit=None, post_visit=None)`: Tree-specific DFS
- `create_parent_array(graph, root=0)`: Create an array of parent nodes
- `count_components(graph)`: Count connected components
- `find_tree_depth(graph, root=0)`: Find depths of all nodes
- `find_max_depth(graph, root=0)`: Find maximum depth of a tree

## 3. Utility Functions

Various utility functions for common operations:
- `create_2d_array(n, m, default=0)`: Create a 2D array with default values
- `format_output(value)`: Format output according to expected format

## Implementation Approach

The library has been incrementally built based on patterns identified in the problems:
1. First implemented basic I/O functions
2. Added graph representations and basic operations
3. Added more specialized tree operations
4. Updated the library as more patterns were discovered during refactoring

## Refactoring Strategy

For each problem, we've:
1. Analyzed the original solution
2. Identified parts that can be replaced with library functions
3. Refactored using the library components
4. Tested to ensure the solution works
5. Updated the library if needed

## Future Improvements

Based on the remaining problems to refactor, we might add:
1. More specialized graph algorithms
2. Additional utility functions
3. Support for different input formats

## Successfully Refactored Problems

We've successfully refactored several problems to use our library:
- 982_c_cut_em_all_5275: Tree subtree size calculation
- 839_c_journey_2458: Tree traversal with probabilities
- 902_b_coloring_a_tree_2877: Tree coloring
- 116_c_party_7303: Finding maximum tree depth
- 292_b_network_topology_9930: Degree-based topology identification
- 580_c_kefa_and_park_5570: Tree traversal with constraints
- 1133_f1_spanning_tree_with_maximum_degree_10945: Maximizing degree in spanning tree

We'll continue refactoring the remaining problems, adding to the library as needed.
