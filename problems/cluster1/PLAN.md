# Library Design Plan for Cluster 1

Based on analysis of the problems in cluster 1, I've identified that most problems involve number theory concepts. Here's a plan for designing a comprehensive library to minimize code across all solutions.

## Common Patterns Identified

1. **Number Theory Functions**:
   - Prime number checking (isPrime)
   - Prime factorization
   - Finding all divisors of a number
   - GCD and LCM calculations
   - Modular exponentiation and arithmetic
   - Euler's totient function
   - Finding minimum prime factor
   - Factors counting

2. **Input/Output Patterns**:
   - Reading single integers
   - Reading multiple integers from a line
   - Reading multiple test cases
   - Printing arrays/lists in various formats

3. **Data Structures**:
   - Stacks/Queues (rarely used but seen in some problems)
   - Counter/Frequency tracking

## Library Structure

The library will be organized into the following modules:

### 1. Input/Output Module
- Functions for handling standard input and output operations
- Test case parsing
- Formatted output

### 2. Number Theory Module
- Prime checking and generation
- Factor and divisor generation
- GCD, LCM and related functions
- Modular arithmetic functions
- Prime factorization functions

### 3. Utility Module
- Basic math helper functions
- Reusable data structure operations

## Implementation Plan

1. Start with implementing the core number theory functions as these appear most frequently
2. Add input/output utilities to streamline parsing
3. Implement additional helper functions as needed
4. Refactor each solution to use the library, starting with those that have the clearest patterns
5. Continue to evolve the library as we encounter new patterns in the refactoring process

## Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names for all functions
- Follow Python naming conventions (snake_case for functions and variables)
- Use consistent parameter naming across similar functions
- Include docstrings with examples for all functions

This plan will be updated as we progress through the refactoring of solutions and identify additional patterns or improvements.
