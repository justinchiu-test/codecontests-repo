# Plan

## Library Design

We will implement a shared library with the following components:

### Input Parsing Utilities
- I(): Read a single integer from stdin
- MI(): Read a line of space-separated integers as a map(int, ...)
- LI(): Read a line of space-separated integers as a list
- LLI(n): Read n lines, each as a list of integers
- S(): Read a stripped string
- SS(): Read a line of space-separated strings

### Math Utilities
- gcd(a, b): Greatest common divisor
- lcm(a, b): Least common multiple
- factors(n): List all divisors of n
- is_prime(n): Primality test (O(âˆšn))
- prime_sieve(n): List primes up to n
- factorize(n): Prime factorization as a dict
- nCr(n, r): Compute combinations

Additional utilities will be added as needed when refactoring solutions.

## Refactoring Checklist

We will refactor every problem to use the above library functions.
Mark each as completed when the solution is updated and passes its tests.
