# Library Plan for Cluster6

Based on the analysis of the problems in this cluster, we need to create a library focused on mathematical operations, probability calculations, and combinatorial utilities. The main themes are:

1. Mathematical calculations
2. Probability problems
3. Dynamic programming with probabilities
4. Combinatorial problems

## Proposed Library Structure

### 1. Input/Output Utilities
- Functions to parse common input patterns
- Functions to handle multiple test cases

### 2. Mathematical Utilities
- GCD, LCM functions
- Modular arithmetic (particularly with 10^9+7)
- Fraction simplification
- Prime number utilities

### 3. Combinatorial Utilities
- Factorial calculations (with and without modulo)
- Combinations and permutations
- Modular inverse calculations
- Binomial coefficients

### 4. Probability Helpers
- Common probability calculations
- Expected value utilities
- DP templates for probability problems

### 5. Fast I/O
- Fast input/output utilities for problems with strict time limits

## Implementation Status

The library has been implemented with the following features:
- Basic math operations (gcd, lcm, modular arithmetic, fraction simplification)
- Combinatorial utilities (factorial, combinations, permutations) with caching for efficiency
- Input/output utilities (read_int, read_ints, solve_multiple_cases)
- Fast I/O implementation for performance-sensitive problems
- Probability utility functions
- Array and sequence utilities
- Game theory utilities
- DP templates for probability problems

## Next Steps

Continue refactoring the remaining problems, focusing on:

1. Problems with similar patterns to those already refactored
2. Problems that can leverage our combinatorial utilities
3. Problems that use dynamic programming with probabilities

For each refactored problem, verify that it passes all tests before moving on to the next one. Continue to enhance the library as needed for each problem.
