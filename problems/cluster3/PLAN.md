# Library Plan for Cluster3

Based on analyzing the problems in this cluster, I've identified several common patterns that can be abstracted into reusable components:

## 1. IO Utilities
- Fast IO wrapper for improved performance
- Common input parsing patterns (integers, lists, matrices)
- Output formatting

## 2. Tree Algorithms
- Tree construction from edges
- DFS/BFS traversals (both recursive and iterative)
- Post-order, pre-order, and level-order traversals
- Tree recoloring and tree weights
- Subtree computation
- Dynamic programming on trees

## 3. Graph Utilities
- Adjacency list representation
- Common graph operations

## 4. Utilities
- Recursion optimization with bootstrapping/trampolining
- Common mathematical operations
- Array/list operations

## Implementation Plan

1. Create the IO component first, as it's used by most solutions
2. Implement tree operations and traversals
3. Add utilities for working with trees
4. Implement graph utilities
5. Add any remaining helper functions

## Common Patterns Observed

1. Many tree problems use DFS traversals extensively
2. Rerooting DP is a common pattern in tree problems
3. Iterative approaches are sometimes preferred to avoid stack overflows
4. Fast IO is important for problems with large input sizes
5. Post-order traversal is particularly useful for DP on trees
6. When finding paths in trees, we often need to consider pairs of paths meeting at a node
7. Similar problems often involve finding the maximum weighted path in a tree
8. Rerooting technique is powerful for calculating values for all possible roots
9. Weighted trees often need both node values and subtree sums for efficient calculations
10. BFS is useful for level-order processing and constructing parent relationships
11. Similar problems can have different implementations but share core algorithms
12. Complex state DP on trees is common for counting problems
13. Greedy algorithms often work well on trees with specific scoring functions
14. Bottom-up approach (from leaves to root) is effective for many tree problems

Next Steps:
1. Continue refactoring the remaining problems
2. Enhance library with specialized tree DP algorithms
3. Add more helper functions for common subtasks
4. Standardize function signatures and parameter conventions

I'll continue refactoring the remaining problems, enriching the library with more utilities, and improving existing implementations.
