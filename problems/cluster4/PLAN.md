# Library Design Plan for Cluster 4 (Geometry Problems)

Based on the analysis of problems in this cluster, I've identified that most problems are geometry-related. Here's my plan for creating a reusable library:

## 1. Input/Output Utilities

- Functions for parsing common input patterns:
  - Reading integers, floats, and arrays
  - Reading coordinates (points)
  - Reading multiple lines of input

## 2. Geometry Data Structures and Operations

- Point/Vector class:
  - 2D and potentially 3D points
  - Vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product)
  - Distance calculations
  - Vector normalization

- Line class:
  - Line representation (ax + by + c = 0)
  - Line-point distance
  - Line-line intersection
  - Creating a line from two points

- Circle class:
  - Circle representation (center point and radius)
  - Circle-circle intersection
  - Circle-line intersection
  - Point-in-circle check

- Polygon utilities:
  - Area calculation
  - Perimeter calculation
  - Check if a point is inside a polygon
  - Convex hull algorithm

## 3. Math Utilities

- GCD and LCM functions
- Number theory helpers
- Angle conversion and normalization
- Handling floating-point precision issues

## 4. Common Algorithms

- Connected components for geometric structures
- Sorting points (by angle, by distance)
- Determining orientation of a triplet of points

## Implementation Strategy

1. First implement the basic Point/Vector class since it's foundational to most geometry problems
2. Add input/output utilities for common patterns
3. Implement Line and Circle classes
4. Add polygon utilities and other algorithms
5. Continuously refactor the solutions to use the library as it evolves

I will update this plan as I work through the problems and identify more reusable components.
