# 1174_D. Ehab and the Expected XOR Problem

**ID:** 1174_d_ehab_and_the_expected_xor_problem_10531
**Difficulty:** 10

## Description

Given two integers n and x, construct an array that satisfies the following conditions:

  * for any element a_i in the array, 1 ≤ a_i<2^n;
  * there is no non-empty subsegment with [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) equal to 0 or x,
  * its length l should be maximized.



A sequence b is a subsegment of a sequence a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The only line contains two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 18, 1 ≤ x<2^{18}).

Output

The first line should contain the length of the array l.

If l is positive, the second line should contain l space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_l (1 ≤ a_i < 2^n) — the elements of the array a.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input


3 5


Output


3
6 1 3

Input


2 4


Output


3
1 3 1

Input


1 1


Output


0

Note

In the first example, the bitwise XOR of the subsegments are \{6,7,4,1,2,3\}.
