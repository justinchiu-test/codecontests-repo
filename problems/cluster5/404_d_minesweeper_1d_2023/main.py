    Solution for the Minesweeper 1D problem.

    We use a dynamic programming approach with state transitions based on the current
    cell value and previous state values.

    - a: Cell is a mine with a mine to the left
    - b: Cell is a mine with no mine to the left
    - c: Cell is not a mine with no mine to the left
    - d: Cell is not a mine with a mine to the left
