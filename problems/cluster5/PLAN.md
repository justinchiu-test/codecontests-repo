# Library Development Plan for Cluster5

## Plan Overview

The goal of this project was to identify common patterns across multiple problem solutions and extract them into a shared library to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

## Library Components

The library was organized into the following components:

### 1. Input/Output Utilities
- `read_int()`, `read_ints()`, `read_int_tuple()`: Functions to read integers in various formats
- `read_str()`, `read_strs()`: Functions to read strings in various formats

### 2. String Algorithms
- `z_function()`: Implementation of Z-algorithm for efficient string pattern matching
- `calc_prefix()`: KMP algorithm implementation for prefix matching

### 3. Dynamic Programming Utilities
- `create_dp_table()`: Helper for creating and initializing 2D DP tables
- `create_dp_table_3d()`: Helper for creating and initializing 3D DP tables

### 4. Data Structures
- Segment tree functions: `update()` and `query()` for range operations

## Common Patterns Found

1. **String Processing**
   - Z-function algorithm for string matching
   - Dynamic programming on strings
   - Subsequence and substring operations

2. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Table initialization patterns
   - DP state transitions in string problems
   - Substring/subsequence counting and optimization

3. **Input/Output**
   - Common patterns for reading input in competitive programming
   - String and integer parsing

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Reduction**: Eliminated duplicate code across multiple solutions
2. **Increased Readability**: Problem solutions now focus on the algorithm, not boilerplate
3. **Improved Maintenance**: Changes to library functions propagate to all solutions
4. **Consistent Style**: Standardized approaches and naming conventions

## Project Completion Status

All problems in cluster5 have been successfully refactored to use the shared library. The refactoring process has significantly reduced code duplication while maintaining or improving the readability and maintainability of the solutions.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more specialized string algorithms for specific problem types
2. Expand dynamic programming utilities with common DP patterns
3. Implement more robust testing for library functions
4. Create additional data structure implementations for specialized problems
5. Extend modular arithmetic capabilities to handle matrix operations
6. Add advanced data structures like Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
7. Implement graph algorithms for problems requiring graph representations

The library provides a solid foundation for solving competitive programming problems efficiently while maintaining code quality and readability.
