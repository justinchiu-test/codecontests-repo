# Library Development Plan for Cluster 5

## Implemented Library Structure

After analyzing the problems in this cluster, I've created a comprehensive library with the following components:

### 1. Input/Output Utilities
- `read_int()`: Read a single integer from input
- `read_ints()`: Read a list of integers from input
- `read_int_tuple()`: Read integers as a tuple
- `setup_fast_io()`: Setup fast IO for competitive programming

### 2. String Algorithms
- `build_next_occurrence(s, alphabet_size, offset)`: Build next occurrence array for string s
- `z_algorithm(s)`: Compute Z-function for string s or sequence
- `is_subsequence(a, b)`: Check if string a is a subsequence of string b

### 3. Dynamic Programming Utilities
- `memoize(f)`: Memoization decorator for functions
- `initialize_dp_table(dimensions, default_value)`: Initialize a multi-dimensional DP table

### 4. Data Structures
- `get_segment_tree_size(n)`: Calculate the size needed for a segment tree
- `create_segment_tree(n)`: Create a segment tree of size n
- `update_segment_tree(tree, pos, diff, size)`: Update a segment tree at position pos
- `query_segment_tree(tree, l, r, size)`: Query a segment tree for the sum between positions l and r

### 5. Mathematical Utilities
- `MOD`: Constant for 10^9+7
- `mod_add(a, b, mod)`: Modular addition
- `mod_mult(a, b, mod)`: Modular multiplication
- `mod_pow(base, exp, mod)`: Modular exponentiation

## Refactoring Results

Successfully refactored several key problems to use the library components. The refactoring:
1. Reduced code duplication across problems
2. Improved code clarity through better function naming and documentation
3. Made common operations more consistent and reliable
4. Added type hints and documentation to improve code maintainability

## Key Problem Patterns Identified

1. **String Problems**:
   - Next occurrence arrays for subsequence checking
   - Z-algorithm for pattern matching
   - Lexicographic ordering and transformations

2. **Dynamic Programming Problems**:
   - Multidimensional DP arrays with various state transitions
   - Optimization problems with constraint satisfaction
   - Counting problems with modular arithmetic

3. **Range Query Problems**:
   - Segment trees for range sum queries
   - Prefix computations

4. **Math Problems**:
   - Modular arithmetic for large number computations
   - Combinatorial counting problems

## Future Improvements

1. Add more specialized functions for:
   - Parsing complex input formats
   - More string algorithms (KMP, suffix arrays)
   - Advanced data structures (sparse tables, trie)

2. Further optimization of existing functions for:
   - Time efficiency
   - Memory efficiency
   - Edge case handling

3. Better error handling and input validation

The library in its current state provides a solid foundation for solving the problems in this cluster while maintaining code clarity and reducing duplication.
